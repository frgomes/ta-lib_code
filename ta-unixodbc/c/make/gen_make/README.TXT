How to regenerate the Makefiles?
================================
Do the following:
  c:\ta-unixodbc\c\make\gen_make> perl ./gen_make.pl

==============
What is tmake?
==============
The makefiles are generated by tmake. This utility
is not included in this package. This is freely
available from Trolltech (the maker of the QT
library). Just put the tmake in your path and
you are done (ta-lib comes with all the required
template).

================================
Porting to new Compiler/platform
================================
If you can't find your platform-compiler
in the ta-lib/c/make/template, you may consider
to copy additional templates from the TMAKE
distribution. 

The gen_make.pl will create all the needed
directories and generates Makefiles for all
templates find in ta-lib/c/make/template.
